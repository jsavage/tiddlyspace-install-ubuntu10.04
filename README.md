tiddlyspace-install-Ubuntu10.04
===============================

This script is being developed to install a default instance of 
Tiddlyspace on Ubuntu 10.04 for evaluation purposes but in a manner that 
can be built upon and repeated. 

This work is based on installation instruction published by C Dent at
http://cdent.tiddlyspace.com/Hosting%20your%20own%20tiddlyspace 

Since no plan to use a password to access database initially, config.py 
does not need to be changed.

This script was developed and tested for use with a Cloud based image of 
Ubuntu server running behind a corporate firewall.   

The script makes no intentional assumptions about existing user 
accounts and the intention is to run this script and install as root and 
then run tiddlyspace server under a new account called tiddlyserver. 

Comments, contributions and improvements welcome.
